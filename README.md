# burger

ABOUT:
* The Burger app combines UI and UX design, allowing users to add burgers to the app's MySQL database (burger_db), then devouring the burgers.

APP OVERVIEW:
* A manual ORM system was used to simplify the process of transferring information between the MySQL database into objects.

* The app consists of 6 main files (public, db, config, models, controllers, and views) that connects the MySQL database to the website. Rather than using .html documents, .handlebars are used (main.handlebars & index.handlebars). 


HOW TO USE Friend Finder:
1. Open the Heroku hosted link

2. If wanting to devour one of the burgers in the "Ordered Burgers" list, click on the blue "Devour!" button (located under each corresponding burger).

3. After clicking the button, the burger should now be under the "Devoured Burgers" list.

* If you would like to Order a burger, Add a burger name to the textbox, and click on the "Add Burger!" button. The burger will populate in the "Ordered Burgers" section, with a "Devour!" button underneath your added burger name.
